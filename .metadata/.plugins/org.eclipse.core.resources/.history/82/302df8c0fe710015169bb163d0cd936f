	//1: Write a program that uses a for loop to print
	for(int i=0; i< 10; i++){
		
		for(int I=0; I<3; I++){
			System.out.println("baby");
		}
		if(i%2==0){
			
		}
	}
	//baby
	//baby
	//baby
	//oh
	//Code should only contain one “baby”, and one “oh”

	//2: Every 2nd time the “oh” should be “no”

	//3: Each chorus ends with “I thought you'd always be mine”.
